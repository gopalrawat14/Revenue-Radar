## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a visually engaging and intuitive **Overview Dashboard** that allows business users to:

- Quickly track operational KPIs such as sales, orders, customers, and returns.
- Understand financial performance through segmented donut charts and diverging bar charts.
- Explore trends over time with sparkline visualizations.
- Analyze cost breakdowns with gradient lollipop charts.
- Navigate seamlessly across multiple dashboards: **Overview → Sales → Orders**.

This dashboard is designed to help decision-makers identify trends, monitor performance, and uncover insights without needing to dig into raw data.
